# ScratchWork

Welcome to my little repository of one-off code. Whenever I get an idea and want to test it, that code winds up here. I realized I don't really work continuously on big projects outside of work, but rather enjoy the little experiments. If programming is art, these are doodles. I want to keep track of these, rather than waiting for the next hard drive failure to take them away. That means some of this code might not function correctly, might be nonsensical, or ideas that I'd never do in production, but just for fun.
